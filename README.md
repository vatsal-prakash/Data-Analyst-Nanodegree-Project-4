# Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 4 on Data Wrangling 

In this project data is gathered from multiple sources (such as flat files, HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files) by programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs.
Content or “quality” issues that lead to dirty data and structural or “tidiness” issue that lead to messy data are identified. 
The data was then cleaned and stored as one master dataset which was then visualized and analyzed
